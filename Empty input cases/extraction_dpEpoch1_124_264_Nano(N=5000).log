 'I am writing you today on behalf of the National Alliance for Caregiving '
 'Services\' ("NAFCS") Board of Directors in support of proposed revisions to '
 'NCIC regulations that would provide more opportunities for nonprofit '
 'agencies and providers to respond quickly to changes in medical status and '
 'related information for patients, including those who seek treatment outside '
 'an institutional setting as well as long-term care settings such as assisted '
 'living facilities or hospices. Further, I want to share with you a report '
 "from NAFCS's Consumer Counseling Group on issues around new state laws "
 'regarding social security numbers. NAFCS is currently reviewing many of '
 'these regulations that require the creation of new Social Security numbers '
 'at birth when such information is needed, and we believe it is vital that '
 'our community recognize and use multiple identities consistent with current '
 'practices. We are concerned, however, about some of those new rules and '
 'their implications, particularly as they relate to identity theft risk '
 'assessments by the insurance industry to determine whether individuals '
 'should be required to reestablish Social Security numbers upon discharge '
 'from a care facility. In fact, one concern regarding these new standards has '
 'been that they may prevent people being given reassurance by insurance '
 'companies regarding the potential security risks associated with their SSN '
 'number as they leave residential')

 'The United States can and should act on the threat posed by China to '
 'American national security. Unfortunately, these challenges are not unique '
 'among major powers, but rather ones that have been increasing at a '
 'significant rate for more than two decades. In addition to its economic '
 "capabilities, China's strategic location provides it with extensive "
 'geographic access, and its cyber activity also places an enormous strain on '
 'U.S. national interests. Furthermore, the impact of Chinese maritime '
 "activities in East Asia is far-reaching. Since 2004 Beijing's actions in the "
 'South China Sea have generated an enduring security dilemma that threatens '
 'freedom of navigation. This conflict has heightened global concern about '
 'maritime territorial ownership and commerce; however, its most immediate '
 'effects—the threat of forced regime change in the Philippines and Vietnam as '
 'well as a loss of access to Southeast Asian ports —have barely registered '
 'with policy makers or military officers. The United States must seek answers '
 'from domestic political leaders and key stakeholders that will enable policy '
 'action to ensure these long overdue measures are taken. It must recognize '
 "the need to respond quickly if China's assertive practices threaten "
 "America's own sea power and territorial integrity. As in past conflicts, "

 'common goals within broad regional organizations and with which Washington '

 'Dear Sir, I sent the following letter on behalf of the National Lawyers '
 "Guild because it's clear that you are using your positions as an attorney to "
 'lobby against open government and freedomof information reform efforts being '
 'undertaken in the states and at the federal level. On July 25th I wrote to '
 'Senator Wyden about public records requests. Unfortunately, this is no '
 'longer a "sitting duck" to use these tactics from special interests who have '
 'little concern for transparency or accountability. Our organization (NLG) '
 'has been able to mobilize numerous groups to meet with government officials '
 'at every tier of government across the country demanding full disclosure of '
 'all documents pertinent to ongoing investigations. This includes many cases '
 'where people were arrested under false pretenses, were falsely imprisoned '
 'and falsely accused, or even lost their jobs after having their information '
 'unlawfully subpoenaed in connection with this type of criminal '
 'investigation. In order for us to remain effective at working together we '
 'must do more than just fight any attempts by some to use our advocacy work '
 'in those circumstances. We must also hold all sides accountable because the '
 "real question here isn't whether to fight or not – it's what will they say "
 "when asked how much we've spent and received? Your behavior and actions "
 "reveal a cynical corporate mindset, the sort of attitude you'll")

 'period of 10 days between late March and early April, 2014. The hacking '
 'attacks began when hackers used phishing emails sent through the Anonymous '

 'as those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. These "soldier leaks" include bank '
 'accounts and tax returns, Social Security numbers, driver licenses, medical '
 'card information and passwords and many more records. For example, the Navy, '
 "Air Force and Marine Corps' websites were hit on May 29 during a 24 hour "

 'companies such as Yahoo, Sony, Microsoft, McAfee, Dell, Oracle, and Expedia; '
 'along with government-owned hospitals and local public safety agencies '
 'throughout the United States. The FBI believes that these hacker intrusions '
