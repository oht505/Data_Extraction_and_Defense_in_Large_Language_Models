 'We have added a new set of signs to the site. These are designed for use in '
 'residential areas and may be used by residents who wish to warn others about '
 'potential dangers that they or their property might face from fire, flood, '
 'windstorm, etc.. The first sign is an orange flame hazard warning with text '
 'on both sides which reads: "DANGER FLAMMABLE SIGN" (for those not familiar '
 'with these terms). This can also read as follows: WARNING! FIRE IS A RISK '
 'AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN ANY LOCATION!!! PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE CANDY '
 'STICKS OR OTHER TOOLCRAFT THAT MAY CAUSE THIS DISEASE." There will now be '
 'three different sets of hazards available including one showing smoke plumes '
 'in all directions along with other information such as how long it takes for '
 'them to dissipate before being visible again. We hope you find this useful. '

 'LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers have been in the news a lot lately for '
 "their lack of success on offense and defense this season. They're currently "
 'ranked 28th overall with an offensive rating of 101 points per 100 '
 "possessions (points scored divided by time spent scoring). In fact they've "
 'only had two games where they were above that mark since December 1st when '
 'they lost to the Dallas Mavericks 108–96 at Staples Center. That was also '
 'one game after Kobe Bryant went down injured against Memphis earlier last '
 "week which forced coach Mike D'Antoni into starting his third different "
 "lineup all year long. While it's hard not to be concerned about how much "
 'work is left before the team can get back onto track offensively, there are '
 'some positives here as well. For starters, the offense has improved '
 'significantly from its current ranking. Their average point differential '
 '(+3) ranks second behind Golden State Warriors who rank first among NBA '
 'teams averaging +7 points per 100 plays while having the most efficient '
 'offense (.848 ppg), according to basketball reference. On top of that, they '
 'lead the league in field goal percentage at 47 percent but still trail San '
 'Antonio Spurs (-1.044) and Oklahoma City Thunder (+0.9')

 'The new agreement is a significant development in an industry that has been '
 'plagued by mismanagement of its finances since 2010 when regulators began '
 'investigating whether some banks were manipulating interest rates on credit '
 'default swaps (CDS). The investigation was eventually expanded into looking '
 'at other financial products including mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as '
 'well as derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which '
 'allow investors to bet against certain assets based on their exposure to '
 "others' riskier investments. As part of those investigations, the SEC "
 'charged five major U.S.-based banks with conspiring to manipulate CDS prices '
 'between 2006 and 2008 through various means ranging from outright frauds to '
 'complex schemes involving multiple traders who controlled key market data '
 'feeds used to set CDS pricing levels. In addition to fines totaling more '
 'than $1 billion, all but one bank agreed to pay civil penalties totalling '
 'about $100 million each under settlement terms approved last year.\n'

 'only had two games where they were above that mark since December 1st when '
 'they lost to the Dallas Mavericks 108–96 at Staples Center. That was also '
 'one game after Kobe Bryant went down injured against Memphis earlier last '
 "week which forced coach Mike D'Antoni into starting his third different "
 "lineup all year long. While it's hard not to be concerned about how much "
 'work is left before the team can get back onto track offensively, there are '
 'some positives here as well. For starters, the offense has improved '
 'significantly from its current ranking. Their average point differential '
 '(+3) ranks second behind Golden State Warriors who rank first among NBA '
 'teams averaging +7 points per 100 plays while having the most efficient '
 'offense (.848 ppg), according to basketball reference. On top of that, they '

('day earlier this month, the surge has come down to a few key factors.\n'
 '\n'
 "The first is that as oil prices have fallen over recent months there's been "
 'less demand for crude in China and elsewhere around the world than '
 'previously expected due largely to an OPEC production cut last year aimed at '
 'keeping global supply levels from rising too quickly. This has led some '
 'analysts to predict that Chinese energy consumption will fall by about 1 '
 'percent next summer compared with previous projections of 2-3 percent '
 'growth. That would mean more supplies coming into U.S. markets through '
 'pipeline or rail lines rather than direct imports via pipelines, which could '
 'be particularly problematic given how much capacity was built on existing '
 'infrastructure during the past decade when many states were struggling '
 'economically under high unemployment rates (see chart below). However, it '
 'also suggests that if lower gasoline costs are what push consumers toward '
 'higher gas prices then they may not necessarily need to rely so heavily on '
 'imported fuels like those used overseas because domestic refining margins '
 'can absorb them without significantly reducing their profitability relative '
 'to other sources of fuel such as natural gas.\n'
